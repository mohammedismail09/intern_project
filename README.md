NEW SECTION:
Applying Agile to Internship Tasks

Here is how Agile can be applied in my Internship:
Sprints: Break down tasks into small, manageable units, and prioritize them based on importance. You can then work in 1-2 week sprints, focusing on delivering prioritized outcomes.
Daily Standups: Hold short daily meetings with your mentor or supervisor to discuss daiy progress, roadblocks, and next steps.
Retrospectives: At the end of each sprint, update on what went well and what could be improved or can be learned for the next task or a project.
Feedback: Agile needs constant communication with mentor or supervisor, allowing you to receive quick feedback and support from them.

By applying these principles, I can stay organized, focused, and continuously improve my work during the Internship.
